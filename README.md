# Requested Rolls
This extension allows the GM to send a popup to players for specific specific throws to include the below. It uses the built in manual roll window, so you can either roll physical dice or just hit roll to use the virtual dice. You can also use the console window to set a DC and force the rolls to be done in the dice tower. This extension respects modifiers , such as advantage, applied using the GM's desktop controls.
* Initiative
* Ability checks
* Saves
* Skill checks
* Specific dice

Optionally, this extension can cause a dialog to popup for any saving throw required. This means that when a NPC forces a saving throw, the PC is presented a button to click to actually make the roll. This includes death saving throws and concentration.  Perfect for those who want to feel like they are rolling instead of Fantasy Grounds doing it for them. This setting is managed on a per-user basis in the Fantasy Grounds Options menu, so everyone gets to decide.

The main picture shows a skill roll being sent by the GM to the selected characters.
The second picture shows the configuration tab where you can enter custom skills, abbreviations,  and select which ones to display on the console. Selecting one star adds the entry to the combobox and two stars adds it to the combobox and the collapsible buttons windows.
